# Portfolio-data-analysis

Study project 1: E-commerce.

Product Manager Vasiliy has asked you to analyze completed purchases and answer the following questions:

1. How many users have made a purchase only once?

2. On average, how many orders per month are not delivered for various reasons (provide a breakdown by reason)?

3. For each product, determine which day of the week it is most frequently purchased.

4. What is the average number of purchases per week for each user (broken down by month)?

5. Using pandas, perform a cohort analysis of users.

6. Audience segmentation is often used for in-depth analysis.
   Using Python, build an RFM segmentation of users to evaluate the audience qualitatively.
   Describe in detail how you created the clusters.
   For each RFM segment, define the boundaries of the recency, frequency, and monetary metrics to interpret the clusters.

To solve the task, first conduct an exploratory data analysis and define what qualifies as a "purchase."
You should justify your definition using available data such as payment confirmations, order statuses, and other relevant information.
